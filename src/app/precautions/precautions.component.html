				<h2>Know how it spreads</h2>
				<!-- <p> -->
				<ul>
					<li>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li>
					<li>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</li>
					<li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.</li>
					<li>
						Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
						<ul>
							<li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.
							</li>
							<li>
								These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be
								inhaled into the lungs.
							</li>
							<li>
								Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not
								showing symptoms.</li>
